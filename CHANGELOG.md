## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Minimum Copier version set to 9.1.0.
- `author_name` and `github_owner` in `copier.yml` now have inline validators to ensure they are not empty.
- `FORM_RENDERER` is now set to `django.forms.renderers.TemplatesSetting` by default.
- Test for version in `tests/test_version.py` now correctly bumped by `bumpver`.
- `django-q-registry` added to `requirements.in`.

### Changed

- `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` reverted to `django.db.models.AutoField`. We still have projects that have not migrated to the new field and this change was potentially breaking for them.

- All HTML templates in `src/django_twc_project/templates` have been formatted using djLint.
- Add missing `django-tailwind-cli` build command in CI/CD test job.

    - `prettier` to v4.0.0-alpha.8
    - `ruff-pre-commit` to 0.2.1
    - `rustywind` to 0.21.0
    - `validate-pyproject` to v0.16
- `djhtml` has been swapped out in favor of `djLint` for HTML formatting.
- `pyproject.toml` has been updated and formatted.
    - Add `coverage` config.
    - Add `boto3` and `botocore` to `mypy` ignore list.
    - Actually use Copier `python_version` input for `ruff` Python target version.
    - Add some `ruff` per-file ignores for tests.
    - Add rules for `pyupgrade` to `ruff` config.
- Favicon view in `core.views` now uses `django.contrib.staticfiles` to find the favicon file.
